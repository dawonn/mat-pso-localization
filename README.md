====================

Mobile robot localization using Particle Swarm Optimization

This is a simple localization algorithm for mobile robots that accepts a
prebuilt map of the robot's enviornment stored as an occupancy grid and a
laser scan and returns the best estimated location of the robot. 

A sample map and a few laser scan datasets are included in the repository.
Run the Localize_Search to attempt an exhastive search for the best pose 
estimate and display a plot of the fitness function.
